*Combines: Confounding Audit, Volcano Plot Interpretation, Adjustment Model Puzzle*

## Background

You are given the results of an ExWAS testing 200 exposures against fasting glucose (LBXGLU) in NHANES, adjusted for the standard covariate set (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income). The results include estimates from all 9 adjustment models, a volcano plot, and a correlation matrix among exposures.

Use the provided materials to answer the questions below. This assignment tests your ability to reason about confounding, interpret visualizations, and critically evaluate statistical results — not to write code.

## Part 1: The Confounding Audit (35 points)

The table below shows 6 ExWAS hits for fasting glucose. All are FDR-significant (FDR < 0.05) under the fully adjusted model (Model 9: age, age², sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, survey wave).

| # | Exposure | Category | $\beta$ (adjusted) | FDR |
|---|----------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| 1 | Blood lead (LBXBPB) | Heavy metal | +0.08 | 0.001 |
| 2 | Serum cotinine (LBXCOT) | Smoking biomarker | +0.11 | <0.001 |
| 3 | Serum gamma-tocopherol | Nutrient biomarker | +0.06 | 0.02 |
| 4 | Urinary bisphenol A (URXBPH) | Plasticizer | +0.05 | 0.04 |
| 5 | Blood mercury (LBXTHG) | Heavy metal | -0.07 | 0.008 |
| 6 | Serum trans-beta-carotene | Nutrient biomarker | -0.09 | 0.002 |

For **each** of the 6 exposures:

**(a)** Draw a DAG specific to that exposure-glucose pair. Include at least 3 variables: the exposure, glucose, and at least one confounder. Your DAG should reflect the plausible causal structure — not a generic template. (2 pts each)

**(b)** Identify at least one confounder that the standard covariate set (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education) **does not capture**. Explain why it is a confounder (i.e., how it affects both the exposure and glucose). (2 pts each)

**(c)** For **two** of the 6 exposures, predict the direction of bias from the unmeasured confounder you identified: does omitting it bias the estimate toward the null, away from the null, or is the direction ambiguous? Justify your answer using the structure of your DAG. (3 pts each)

## Part 2: Interpreting the Volcano Plot (30 points)

You are provided with a volcano plot showing all 200 exposures tested against fasting glucose. The x-axis shows the standardized effect estimate ($\beta$), and the y-axis shows $-\log_{10}(p\text{-value})$. Points are colored by exposure category (heavy metals, smoking biomarkers, nutrients, pesticides, plasticizers, PCBs/organochlorines). Horizontal dashed lines mark the Bonferroni and FDR thresholds.

*[Instructor note: provide the volcano plot as a figure.]*

Answer the following:

**(a)** You notice that 5 PCB congeners (PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153, PCB-170, PCB-180) all cluster together in the upper-right quadrant of the volcano plot with similar positive effect estimates ($\beta$ = 0.06-0.09) and all pass the Bonferroni threshold. A student concludes: "Five independent exposures are all associated with glucose — this strongly supports a causal role for PCBs."

Critique this interpretation. In your answer, discuss:
- What you know about the correlation structure among PCB congeners
- Whether these represent 5 independent pieces of evidence or something else
- What the clustering implies about the effective number of tests
- How you would determine whether one PCB is driving the signal vs. all contributing independently
(10 pts)

**(b)** Blood mercury (LBXTHG) appears as a significant **negative** association with glucose ($\beta$ = -0.07, FDR = 0.008). A colleague interprets this as "mercury is protective against diabetes."

Provide an alternative explanation that does not invoke a protective biological effect. Consider:
- What dietary sources contribute to blood mercury levels
- What confounders might create a spurious negative association
- Whether this finding is more likely causal or confounded, and why
(10 pts)

**(c)** Serum gamma-tocopherol ($\beta$ = +0.06, FDR = 0.02) and serum trans-beta-carotene ($\beta$ = -0.09, FDR = 0.002) are both nutrient biomarkers but have **opposite** directions of association with glucose.

Explain why two nutrients might show opposite associations. In your answer, consider:
- Whether both associations are equally likely to be causal
- What dietary patterns or behaviors might explain the opposite signs
- How you would distinguish a true biological effect from confounding by overall diet quality
(10 pts)

## Part 3: The Adjustment Model Puzzle (35 points)

The table below shows the effect estimate ($\beta$) for blood lead (LBXBPB) on fasting glucose across all 9 adjustment models:

| Model | Covariates | $\beta$ | SE | p-value |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | Unadjusted | +0.15 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 2 | Age | +0.12 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 3 | Age + sex | +0.12 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 4 | Age + sex + race/ethnicity | +0.10 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 5 | Age + sex + race/ethnicity + income | +0.08 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 6 | Model 5 + education | +0.08 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 7 | Model 6 + survey wave | +0.08 | 0.02 | <0.001 |
| 8 | Model 7 + BMI | +0.03 | 0.02 | 0.12 |
| 9 | Model 7 + BMI + smoking status | +0.02 | 0.02 | 0.31 |

**(a)** The estimate drops from +0.15 (unadjusted) to +0.10 (Model 4) when race/ethnicity is added. Explain what this tells you about the relationship between race/ethnicity, lead exposure, and glucose. Use the language of confounding. (5 pts)

**(b)** The estimate is stable across Models 5-7 (+0.08) despite adding income, education, and survey wave. Does this stability mean that the estimate is free of confounding? Why or why not? (5 pts)

**(c)** The estimate drops sharply from +0.08 (Model 7) to +0.03 (Model 8) when BMI is added, and the p-value crosses 0.05. Two students offer different interpretations:

- **Student A**: "BMI is a confounder of the lead-glucose relationship. After proper adjustment, the association disappears — lead does not affect glucose."
- **Student B**: "BMI is on the causal pathway from lead to glucose (lead → BMI → glucose). Adding BMI blocks the indirect effect, which is why the estimate shrinks. The total effect of lead on glucose is +0.08, and most of it operates through BMI."

For each student's interpretation:
- Draw the DAG implied by their argument
- Explain under what conditions their interpretation would be correct
- Discuss what additional evidence would help you distinguish between the two interpretations
- Given that the data are **cross-sectional**, which interpretation is more defensible and why?
(15 pts)

**(d)** Now consider a different exposure: serum cotinine (smoking biomarker). Across all 9 adjustment models, the estimate barely changes ($\beta$ ranges from +0.11 to +0.10). Does this mean the cotinine-glucose association is unconfounded? Provide at least two reasons why stability across adjustment models does **not** guarantee the absence of confounding. (10 pts)
