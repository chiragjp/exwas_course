8. Open challenges and future directions

## The Measurement Problem

Throughout this course, we have worked with **targeted** NHANES exposure panels:

- ~619 exposures across 10 waves
- Each analyte requires a **pre-specified assay**
- Only measures what we already know to look for

But the true chemical exposome is **vastly larger**:

- Estimated **tens of thousands** of chemicals in commercial use
- Endogenous metabolites, dietary compounds, drugs, microbiome products
- Transformation products and reactive intermediates
- Novel chemicals not yet cataloged

**How do we measure what we don't know to look for?**

## What is LC-HRMS?

**Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry** couples two technologies:

**Liquid Chromatography (LC)**

- Separates chemicals in a biological sample (blood, urine) by passing them through a column
- Different compounds elute at different **retention times** based on their physicochemical properties
- Common column chemistries: reverse-phase C18, anion exchange (AE), HILIC

**High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS)**

- Ionizes eluting molecules and measures their **mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)** with very high accuracy (<5 ppm mass error)
- Common instruments: Orbitrap, quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF)
- High resolution distinguishes chemicals with nearly identical nominal masses

## How LC-HRMS Works

The workflow for a single sample:

1. **Extract** chemicals from a biological specimen (blood, serum, urine)
2. **Inject** extract into the LC column
3. **Separate** compounds by retention time (minutes)
4. **Ionize** eluting molecules (electrospray ionization)
5. **Measure** accurate mass (m/z) at high resolution
6. **Detect** thousands of **molecular features** (m/z-retention time pairs)

A single LC-HRMS run detects **5,000-20,000+ features** per sample.

Each feature is a potential chemical signal — an endogenous metabolite, an exogenous exposure, a drug, or a transformation product.

## What Can LC-HRMS Measure?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Endogenous metabolites** | Amino acids, lipids, bile acids, acylcarnitines, organic acids, steroids |
| **Exogenous chemicals** | Pesticides, plasticizers (phthalates, BPA), PFAS, flame retardants, PAHs, heavy metal complexes |
| **Drugs and their metabolites** | Pharmaceuticals, phase I/II metabolites (glucuronides, sulfates) |
| **Dietary compounds** | Polyphenols, phytochemicals, food additives, caffeine metabolites |
| **Microbiome-derived** | TMAO, hippuric acid, p-cresol sulfate, indoles, secondary bile acids |
| **Adducts** | HSA-Cys34 adducts from reactive electrophiles (oxidative stress, pollutants) |

The key insight: LC-HRMS captures **both** the internal chemical environment (endogenous) and external exposures (exogenous) **simultaneously**.

## The Blood Exposome

Rappaport et al. (2014) defined the **blood exposome** as the totality of chemicals circulating in blood from both endogenous and exogenous sources:

- Chemicals enter the blood from **external sources** (air, water, diet, drugs, occupation)
- Chemicals also arise from **endogenous processes** (inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, gut microbiome)
- The blood integrates all sources into a single measurable compartment
- LC-HRMS can profile this integrated signal in a single analytical run

This "top-down" approach (measure what's in the blood) complements the "bottom-up" approach (measure every external source) used in traditional exposure assessment.

## Untargeted vs. Targeted: A Comparison

| Dimension | Targeted (e.g., NHANES) | Untargeted LC-HRMS |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Coverage** | Hundreds of pre-specified chemicals | Thousands of features (known + unknown) |
| **Selection** | Must know what to measure *a priori* | Agnostic, discovery-based |
| **Quantification** | Absolute (ng/mL) with reference standards | Semi-quantitative (relative intensity) |
| **Sensitivity** | Very high for targeted analytes (ppb-ppt) | Lower for trace xenobiotics |
| **Discovery** | Limited to known chemicals | Can find novel/unexpected exposures |
| **Annotation** | Known identity | ~80-95% of features are unannotated |
| **Sample volume** | Large volumes for full panel | Small volumes (< 100 $\mu$L) |
| **Cost** | Expensive per analyte | Cost-effective per feature |

Targeted and untargeted approaches are **complementary**, not competing.

## The Annotation Challenge

The single biggest bottleneck in untargeted exposomics:

**Only ~5% of detected features are confidently annotated.**

The **Schymanski confidence levels** provide a standardized framework:

| Level | Confidence | Evidence Required |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Confirmed | Reference standard match (RT + MS + MS/MS) |
| 2 | Probable | Library MS/MS spectral match |
| 3 | Tentative | Molecular formula, partial structural evidence |
| 4 | Formula | Unequivocal molecular formula only |
| 5 | Mass | Exact mass (m/z) only |

Most features in an untargeted run are Level 4-5 — the **"dark matter"** of the exposome.

**Reference:** Schymanski EL, et al. Identifying small molecules via high resolution mass spectrometry: communicating confidence. *Environ Sci Technol* 2014; 48(4):2097-2098.

## Why Dark Matter Matters

The ~80-95% of unannotated features are a mix of:

- **Truly novel** chemicals not in any database
- **Known chemicals** missing from spectral libraries
- **Transformation products** (metabolites of metabolites)
- **Adducts and in-source fragments** (analytical artifacts)
- **Informatic noise** (false peaks from feature detection algorithms)

This means that an LC-HRMS-based ExWAS may find strong associations with features we **cannot yet identify**.

Strategies to reduce dark matter:

- Expand spectral libraries (MassBank, HMDB, METLIN, mzCloud)
- Improve computational annotation (SIRIUS, MS-DIAL, GNPS)
- Use molecular networking to group related unknowns

## Connecting LC-HRMS to ExWAS

The ExWAS framework from Modules 4-5 extends naturally to untargeted data:

```{r lchrms-exwas-concept}
# Conceptual LC-HRMS ExWAS
# Instead of ~619 targeted NHANES exposures,
# we now have ~10,000 LC-HRMS features

features <- colnames(lchrms_matrix)  # m/z_RT feature IDs

results <- map_dfr(features, function(feat) {
  tryCatch({
    mod <- svyglm(
      as.formula(paste("scale(phenotype) ~ scale(", feat, ") + covariates")),
      design = dsn
    )
    tidy(mod) %>% filter(grepl(feat, term)) %>%
      mutate(feature = feat)
  }, error = function(e) NULL)
})

# Apply FDR
results <- results %>%
  mutate(fdr = p.adjust(p.value, method = "BH"))
```

The **same statistical machinery** applies — but the scale changes dramatically.

## The Scale Problem

| Setting | Features tested | Bonferroni threshold |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| NHANES ExWAS (Module 5) | ~619 | $8 \times 10^{-5}$ |
| LC-HRMS ExWAS | ~10,000 | $5 \times 10^{-6}$ |
| LC-HRMS $\times$ multiple phenotypes | ~100,000+ | $5 \times 10^{-7}$ |

With 10,000 features:

- At $\alpha = 0.05$, expect **500 false positives** by chance
- Many features are **highly correlated** (same compound, different adducts; co-eluting chemicals; shared pathways)
- Effective number of independent tests is smaller than the total — but hard to estimate

## Statistical Considerations

Key differences from targeted ExWAS:

**1. Feature correlation is extreme**

- In-source fragments, adducts ([M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+), and isotope peaks of the same compound are perfectly correlated
- Co-eluting compounds from the same biological pathway are highly correlated
- Must account for this when interpreting significance

**2. Semi-quantitative data**

- Relative intensities, not absolute concentrations
- Log-transformation and scaling (Module 3) still apply
- But comparability across studies requires careful normalization

**3. Missing data patterns differ**

- Features below the limit of detection are common
- Missingness may be informative (low abundance $\neq$ zero exposure)
- Imputation strategies matter more than in targeted panels

## A Practical Workflow

Integrating LC-HRMS with the ExWAS pipeline:

**Step 1: Pre-processing**

- Peak detection and alignment (e.g., XCMS, MS-DIAL, MZmine)
- Blank subtraction, batch correction, normalization
- Filter to reproducible features (present in >50% of QC samples)

**Step 2: ExWAS scan**

- Log-transform, scale, apply ExWAS loop (Modules 3-5)
- FDR correction across all features

**Step 3: Annotation of hits**

- Prioritize significant features for identification
- Match to spectral databases (Level 1-3 annotation)
- Use molecular networking to group related unknowns

**Step 4: Validation**

- Replication in independent samples
- Targeted confirmation of top hits with reference standards
- Triangulation with targeted NHANES data where available

## Batch Effects: A Critical Challenge

Large-scale LC-HRMS studies run samples across multiple batches:

- **Signal drift** within a batch (instrument sensitivity changes over hours)
- **Batch-to-batch variation** (column aging, solvent lots, temperature)
- **Long-term drift** (months between batches in a large cohort)

These systematic variations can **confound biological signals**.

Mitigation strategies:

- **Pooled QC samples** run every 10-20 samples to monitor drift
- **Reference standardization** (Go, Walker et al. 2015)
- **Signal normalization**: median fold change, LOESS regression, ComBat
- **Randomized run order** to decouple batch from biological variables

## Scalable Workflows for Population Studies

Moving LC-HRMS from small studies to population-scale cohorts:

Hu, Walker et al. (2021) demonstrated a **scalable single-step extraction** workflow:

- Combined LC-HRMS and GC-HRMS in a single extraction
- Validated across hundreds of samples
- Demonstrated reproducibility for population-scale deployment
- Detected both endogenous metabolites and exogenous chemicals

This is the kind of infrastructure needed to create a "next-generation NHANES" with untargeted exposomics.

## What LC-HRMS Has Already Found

Selected findings from untargeted exposome studies:

- **Novel exposure-disease associations** not detectable with targeted panels (e.g., previously unmeasured dietary metabolites associated with cardiovascular risk)
- **Exposure-metabolite networks** revealing how exogenous chemicals perturb endogenous pathways (Jeong et al., *Sci Rep* 2021)
- **Occupational exposures** detected in firefighters vs. office workers through differential metabolomic profiles
- **Environmental chemical mixtures** that co-occur and may have joint effects on health

The discovery potential is the key advantage — finding associations with chemicals we didn't know to measure.

## The Future: Untargeted ExWAS at Scale

Imagine combining the PE Atlas approach (Module 9) with untargeted LC-HRMS:

| Current (NHANES targeted) | Future (LC-HRMS untargeted) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 619 exposures | 10,000-20,000 features |
| Known chemicals only | Known + unknown chemicals |
| Pre-specified assays | Discovery-driven |
| ~120,000 associations | ~3-6 million associations |
| Targeted replication | Targeted confirmation of unknowns |

The statistical and computational challenges scale accordingly — but the ExWAS framework (Modules 3-7) provides the foundation.

## Summary

- **LC-HRMS** enables untargeted measurement of thousands of chemical features in a single sample
- It captures **endogenous metabolites, exogenous chemicals, drugs, dietary compounds, and microbiome products** simultaneously
- The **annotation bottleneck** (~80-95% unannotated) is the major challenge
- The **ExWAS framework** from this course extends directly to untargeted data — same statistics, larger scale
- **Batch effects** and **semi-quantitative data** require careful pre-processing
- Untargeted and targeted approaches are **complementary** — targeted validates untargeted discoveries
- The future of exposome epidemiology lies in combining LC-HRMS measurement with the ExWAS analytical pipeline at population scale

## What's Next?

The tools are in place:

- **nhanespewas** provides the targeted ExWAS infrastructure (Modules 4-9)
- **LC-HRMS** provides the next-generation measurement platform (this module)
- **Statistical methods** from Modules 3 and 7 scale to untargeted data
- **AI agents** (Module 8) can help manage the complexity

The exposome is no longer limited to what we know to measure — LC-HRMS opens the door to discovering the **unknown unknowns** of environmental health.
